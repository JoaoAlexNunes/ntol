# Nunes Tour of Languages
This was based on metame [mtol](https://github.com/metame/mtol)
</br>
Part 1: Learning the language
- 5 languages in 8 to 10 weeks
- 2 weeks per language

Part 2: Developing a big project
- 5 languages in 8 to 10 weeks
- 1-2 weeks per language

## Schedule Part 1
### Week 1 
* Lisp: Clojure

### Week 3
* FPL: Haskell
    
### Week 5
* ML: Ocaml
  
### Week 7
* Scripting Language: Lua

### Week 9
* System Programing Language: Rust

## Schedule Part 2
### Week 11
* Lisp: Clojure

### Week 13
* FPL: Haskell
    
### Week 15
* ML: Ocaml
  
### Week 17
* Scripting Language: Lua

### Week 19
* System Programing Language: Rust

## Format
1. Getting started docs 15m to 1h
2. Dev env setup: compilers, repls, editor config, etc. 15m to 1h
3. Programing a minigame first week
4. Programing a tournament simulator in the Second Part

## Directory Structure
* Each lang has it's own directory from root
* In the root directory, the README will contain links to the resources used
* Each lang directory will have a `hello_world` subdir with the hello world basic app and a `minigame` and a `tournament simulator` subdir.

### Why a minigame and a tournament simulator
* It's a greate way of showcase what I learned about the languagues,
* It uses the most comon data structures, for example lists, arrays, etc (programing fundamentals).

### Minigame Options
* Tictactoe Console
* Cross words
* Sodoku
