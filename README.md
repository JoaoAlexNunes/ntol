This was based on metame [mtol](https://github.com/metame/mtol)

## Directory Structure
* Each lang has it's own directory from root
* In the root directory, the README will contain links to the resources used
* Each lang directory will have a `hello_world` subdir with the hello world basic app and a `minigame` and a `tournament simulator` subdir.

### Why a minigame and a tournament simulator

* It's a greate way of showcase what I learned about the languagues,
* It uses the most comon data structures, for example lists, arrays, etc.
* Prove of programing fundamentals
