# Nunes Tour of Languages
This was based on metame [mtol](https://github.com/metame/mtol)
</br>
- 5 languages in 8 to 12 weeks
- 3 weeks per language

## Schedule

2. Dev env setup: compilers, repls, editor config, etc. 15m to 1h
3. Programing a minigame first week
4. Programing a tournament simulator second week

## Directory Structure
* Each lang has it's own directory from root
* In the root directory, the README will contain links to the resources used
* Each lang directory will have a `hello_world` subdir with the hello world basic app and a `minigame` and a `tournament simulator` subdir.

### Why a minigame and a tournament simulator
* It's a greate way of showcase what I learned about the languagues,
* It uses the most comon data structures, for example lists, arrays, etc (programing fundamentals).

### Minigame Options
* Tictactoe Console
* Cross words
* Sodoku
