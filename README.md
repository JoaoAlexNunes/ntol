# Nunes Tour of Languages
This was based on metame [mtol](https://github.com/metame/mtol)

#### Status: Ongoing (slow)

Part 1: Learning the language
- 7 languages in 8 to 13 weeks
- 2 weeks per language

## Schedule
### Week 1 
* Lisp: Clojure

## Format
1. Getting started docs 15m to 1h
2. Dev env setup: compilers, repls, editor config, etc. 15m to 1h
3. Programing a minigame

## Directory Structure
* Each lang has it's own directory from root
* In the root directory, the README will contain links to the resources used
* Each lang directory will have a `snippets` subdir with the hello world and fizzbuzz exercises, plus a `minigame` subdir.

### Why a minigame
* It's a greate way of showcase what I learned about the languagues,
* It uses the most comon data structures, for example lists, arrays, etc (programing fundamentals).

### Minigame Options
* Tictactoe Console
* Cross words
* Sodoku
